Code and data to generate figures for Chen, Osimiri, et al 2019 (biorxiv)
Code and data are divided into folders by which figure they relate to. For code in Jupyter notebooks, running the named cells will produce the subpanels. For code in Matlab, running "[output] = function()" will generate the figure and/or subpanel.
