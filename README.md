# CLASP-Crz1
Code and data to generate figures for Chen, Osimiri, et al 2019 (biorxiv)
Code and data are divided into folders by which figure they relate to. For code in Jupyter notebooks, running the named cells will produce the subpanels. For code in Matlab, running "[output] = function()" will generate the figure and/or subpanel.

This is work from UCSF. The pre-print can be found here https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/548255v3. If you are interested in plasmids, please reach out to the El-Samad lab at Hana.El-Samad@ucsf.edu.
