# CLASP-Crz1
Code to generate figures for Chen, Osimiri, et al 2019 (biorxiv).

Code is divided into folders by which figure they relate to. Data is available via Mendeley Data. To run code, add unzip data folder into the same root directory as th code.

For code in Jupyter notebooks, running the named cells will produce the subpanels. For code in Matlab, running "[output] = function()" will generate the figure and/or subpanel.

This is work from UCSF. The pre-print can be found here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/548255v3. If you are interested in plasmids, please reach out to the El-Samad lab at Hana.El-Samad@ucsf.edu.
